       The sentence 'Philosophy is hard' is symbolized by 'H'.\n\
       The sentence 'Philosophy is interesting' is symbolized by 'I'.\n\
       The sentence 'Logic is hard' is symbolized by 'L'.\n\

       a) It is not the case that philosophy is interesting.\n\n\
       b) Philosophy is hard and philosophy is interesting.\n\n\
       c) Philosophy is hard and it is not the case that logic is hard. \n\n\
Form a view as to how the program will symbolize those sentences, \
then ask it to do so. Select the sentence, click To Symbols). When \
you have symbolized the sentences, ask the program to translate them \
back by selecting each symbol and clicking To English.\n\n\
Again, the program will do one step of the translation process. Keep \
selecting inner symbolic subformulas and clicking To English until the \
entire formula is translated. \n\n\
Keep in mind that when you are translating to symbols what you select \
must be in English, and that when you are translating to English what \
you select must be a symbolic formula.\n\n\
When you are half way through the translation process you will have \
something which is part in English and part in symbols-- be sure that \
what you select is entirely in English or entirely in symbols (or \
nothing will happen).",
