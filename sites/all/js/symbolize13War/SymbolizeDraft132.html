For example, 'The bomb explodes if the red button is pushed' amounts to 'If the red button is pushed the bomb explodes'.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;'A only if B' amounts to 'If A then B'. For example, 'Plants flourish only if there is sunlight' amounts to 'If plants flourish there is sunlight'. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;'A unless B' amounts to 'A or B'. For example, 'Plants flourish unless there is no sunlight' amounts to 'Plants flourish or there is no sunlight'. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;A suggestion regarding how to solve translation problems: If you do not recognize the English as an example of a standard form, try to paraphrase it into a standard form. For example, 'Taxes are unpopular, but revenue is needed' is not in a form that we have met, but paraphrasing it to 'Taxes are unpopular and revenue is needed' takes it to a form that we know and which has the same logical structure as the original.&lt;/p&gt;<br>  </p>  </body></html>
